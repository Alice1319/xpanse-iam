# xpanse-iam

This project contains all Infrastructure-as-code required for setting up IAM component of Xpanse.

The idea of IAM implementation in Xpanse is to provide one default implementation using Zitadel IAM product. But it can
be replaced any other IAM implementation which supports OIDC framework.
